# Hangman

## Steps:

- Use name in messages
- Save list of words and create random generator (maybe create list for each category)
- Maybe create an API that generates words for the game (and possibly provides definitions at the end)
- Add in a comment saying how many letters the word is, as well as how many letters you need to find still
- Create option to see the letters you have already used (potentially after the bit where you reuse a letter)
- Add in option for clue for the word (need to create database for clues, definitions, categories and words)
- Add in a scoreboard
